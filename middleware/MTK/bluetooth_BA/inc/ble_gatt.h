 *
 * @section ble_gatt_api_usage How to use this module
 *
 * - Step1: Mandatory, get and save the connection ID from BLE_GAP once a BLE device is connected.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *        static uint16_t conn_id = 0;
 *        void ble_gap_common_callback(ble_event_t event_id, const void* param)
 *        {
 *            switch (event_id) {
 *                case BLE_GAP_CONNECTED_IND: {
 *                    ble_gap_connected_ind_t *evt;
 *                    evt = (ble_gap_connected_ind_t *)param;
 *                    conn_id = evt->conn_id;
 *                    break;
 *                }
 *                default:
 *                    break;
 *            }
 *        }
 *     @endcode
 *
 * - Step2: Mandatory, implement the API #ble_gatts_common_callback() to handle the events sent by GATT client.
 *          An event handler is provided as a sample code for each API.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *        void ble_gatts_common_callback(ble_event_t event_id, const void *param)
 *        {
 *            switch (event_id) {
 *                case BLE_GATT_EXCHANGE_MTU_REQ: {
 *                    ble_gatt_exchange_mtu_req_t *req = (ble_gatt_exchange_mtu_req_t *)param;
 *                    break;
 *                }
 *                case BLE_GATTS_HANDLE_VALUE_CNF: {
 *                    ble_gatts_handle_value_cnf_t *hvc = (ble_gatts_handle_value_cnf_t *)param;

 *                    ble_gatts_read_req_t *read_req = (ble_gatts_read_req_t *)param;
 *                    break;
 *                }
 *                case BLE_GATTS_WRITE_REQ: {
 *                    ble_gatts_write_req_t *write_req = (ble_gatts_write_req_t *)param;
 *                    break;
 *                }
 *                case BLE_GATTS_EXECUTE_WRITE_REQ: {
 *                    ble_gatts_execute_write_req_t *req = (ble_gatts_execute_write_req_t *)param;
 *                    break;
 *                }
 *                default:
 *                    break;
 *            }
 *        }
 *     @endcode
 *
 * - Step3: Mandatory, implement the API #ble_gattc_common_callback() to handle the events sent by GATT server.
 *          An event handler is provided as a sample code for each API.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *        void ble_gattc_common_callback(ble_event_t event_id, const void *param)
 *        {
 *            switch (event_id) {
 *                case BLE_GATT_EXCHANGE_MTU_RSP: {
 *                    ble_gatt_exchange_mtu_rsp_t *mtu_rsp = (ble_gatt_exchange_mtu_rsp_t *)param;
 *                    break;
 *                }
