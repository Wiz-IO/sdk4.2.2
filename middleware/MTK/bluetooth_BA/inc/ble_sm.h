 *
 * @section ble_sm_api_usage How to use this module
 *
 * - Step1: Mandatory, implement the API #ble_sm_common_callback() to handle the events sent by the SM.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *        void ble_sm_common_callback(ble_event_t event_id, const void *param)
 *        {
 *            switch (event_id) {
 *                case BLE_SM_STORE_KEYS_REQ: {
 *                    //Store the keys into a flash memory or file system.
 *                }
 *                case BLE_SM_RETRIEVE_KEYS_REQ: {
 *                    //Get the keys from flash memory or file system then fill in the parameter.
 *                }
 *                default:
 *                    break;
 *            }
 *        }
 *     @endcode
 * - Step2: Mandatory, implement the API #ble_sm_get_io_capability(), SM will call this API to get the IO capability based on hardware features of the device. The value should be fixed in compile time.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *        ble_sm_io_capability_t ble_sm_get_io_capability(void)
 *        {
 *            return BLE_SM_IO_CAPABILITY_NO_INPUT_NO_OUTPUT;
 *        }
 *     @endcode
 * - Step3: Optional, call #ble_sm_is_pairing_authorization_enabled() to check the old value, then call #ble_sm_set_pairing_authorization() to enable/disable pairing authorization.
 *          Once the pairing result is available, please reset to the old value.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *        bool enabled;
 *        enabled = ble_sm_is_pairing_authorization_enabled();
 *        if (!enabled) {
 *            ble_sm_set_pairing_authorization(true);
 *        }
 *        //Reset the value after obtaining the pairing result.
 *        void ble_sm_common_callback(ble_event_t event_id, const void *param)
 *        {
 *            switch (event_id) {
 *                case BLE_SM_PAIRING_RESULT_IND: {
 *                    ble_sm_set_pairing_authorization(enabled);
 *                }
 *                default:
 *                    break;
 *        }
 *     @endcode
 * - Step4: Optional, call #ble_sm_bond() to pair with a remote device. This API performs the STK encryption procedure once the pairing is finished.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *        ble_status_t status;
 *        ble_sm_pairing_attribute_t local_attributes = {true, true, false};//mitm, bond, oob
 *        U8 device_bt_addr[6] = {0x10, 0x06, 0x00, 0x86, 0x19, 0x00};
 *        ble_sm_set_pairing_authorization(true);
 *        status = ble_sm_bond((ble_address_t*)device_bt_addr, &local_attributes);
 *     @endcode
 * - Step5: Optional, call #ble_sm_encrypt() to only encrypt with a paired remote device using LTK. This is usually performed after reconnecting with the paired remote device.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code
 *        ble_status_t status;
 *        U8 device_bt_addr[6] = {0x10, 0x06, 0x00, 0x86, 0x19, 0x00};
 *        ble_sm_encrypt_keyset_t encrypt_keyset = {0};
 *
 *        encrypt_keyset.ediv = ediv; //EDIV is the key value of a remote device after bond.
 *        encrypt_keyset.rand = rand; //Rand is the key value of a remote device after bond.
 *        OS_MemCpy(encrypt_keyset.ltk, ltk, SM_LTK_VALUE_LENGTH); //LTK is the key value of remote device after bond.
 *        status = ble_sm_encrypt((ble_address_t*)device_bt_addr, &encrypt_keyset);
 *     @endcode
