 * This section describes the SPP APIs.
 * The Serial Port Profile (SPP) can be used to emulate a serial port connection using RFCOMM protocol between two peer devices.
 *
 * Supported features
 * ======
 * - \b SPP \b Server \n
 * SPP server is implemented for a server side connection (Device B, Acceptor) according to the SPP specification. It can wait
 * for another device to take initiative to connect.
 * - \b SPP \b Client \n
 * SPP client is implemented for a client side connection (Device A, Initiator) according to the SPP specification. It can
 * initiate a connection with another device.

 * |\b SPP                        | Serial Port Profile, a Bluetooth wireless-interface profile. It emulates a serial cable to provide a simple substitute for existing RS-232, including the familiar control signals. |
 * |\b RFCOMM                     | The Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) is a simple set of transport protocols, made on top of the L2CAP protocol, providing emulated RS-232 serial ports. |
 * |\b SDP                        | Service Discovery Protocol. Used to allow devices to discover what services are supported by each other, and what parameters to use to connect to them. |
 *
 * @section bt_spp_api_usage How to use this module
 * - SPP connection in Server mode.
 *  - Step1: Call #bt_spp_start_service() to create a SPP server instance by registering a RFCOMM channel and SDP service record,
 *           then waiting for the SPP client on a remote device to connect.
 *    @code
 *       port = bt_spp_start_service(uuid128, NULL, server_app_callback);
 *    @endcode
 *  - Step2: If a remote SPP client initiates a connection to the SPP server, the #BT_SPP_CONNECT_IND event is generated to trigger a server callback function registered with the #bt_spp_start_service().
 *  - Step3: Call #bt_spp_connect_response() to accept or reject this connection request from the remote SPP client.
 *    @code
 *       server_app_callback(bt_event_t event_id, void* parameter)
 *       {
 *           switch (event_id) {
 *               case BT_SPP_CONNECT_IND:
 *                   bt_spp_connect_response(parameter->port, true, spp_tx_buf, tx_buf_size, spp_rx_buf, rx_buf_size);
 *                   break;
 *               default:
 *                   break;
 *           }
 *       }
 *    @endcode
 *  - Step4: A #BT_SPP_CONNECT_CNF event is generated to trigger the server callback function if the device is connected.
 * - SPP connection in Client mode.
 *  - Step1: Call #bt_spp_connect() to initiate a connection to a remote server.
 *    @code
 *        bt_spp_connect(remote_address, uuid128, spp_tx_buffer, tx_size, spp_rx_buffer, rx_size, client_app_callback);
 *    @endcode
 *  - Step2: A #BT_SPP_CONNECT_CNF event is generated to trigger the client callback function registered with the #bt_spp_connect() if the device is connected.
 * -  Write data.
 *  - Step1: Call #bt_spp_write() to send application data to the remote device.
 *           If returned value is less than the size of application data to write, the application must wait for #BT_SPP_READY_TO_WRITE_IND event for the next write.
 *    @code
 *        int32_t total_sent_size = 0;
 *        uint32_t total_size = 1000;
 *        uint8_t app_data[1000];
 *        do {
 *            uint32_t real_sent_size = 0;
 *            real_sent_size = bt_spp_write(port, app_data + 1000 - total_size, total_size - total_sent_size);
 *            if (real_sent_size > 0) {
 *                total_sent_size += real_sent_size;
 *            } else {
 *                break;
 *            }
 *        } while (total_size - total_sent_size > 0);
 *    @endcode
 *  - Step2: If the application received #BT_SPP_READY_TO_WRITE_IND event, it can continue to write the rest of application data.
 *    @code
 *        do {
 *            uint32_t real_sent_size = 0;
 *            real_sent_size = bt_spp_write(port, app_data + 1000 - total_size, total_size - total_sent_size);
 *            if (real_sent_size > 0) {
 *                total_sent_size += real_sent_size;
 *            } else {
 *                break;
 *            }
 *        } while (total_size - total_sent_size > 0);
 *    @endcode
 * -  Read data.
 *  - Step1: Call #bt_spp_read() to receive application data from the remote device.
 *           If returned value is less than the size of application data to read, the application must wait for #BT_SPP_READY_TO_READ_IND event for the next read.
 *    @code
 *        int32_t total_received_size = 0;
 *        uint8_t app_rx_buffer[1000];
 *        uint32_t total_size = 1000;
 *        do {
 *            int32_t real_received_size = 0;
 *            real_received_size = bt_spp_read(port, app_rx_buffer + total_received_size, total_size - total_received_size);
 *            if (real_received_size > 0) {
 *                total_received_size += real_received_size;
 *            } else {
 *                break;
 *            }
 *        } while (total_size - total_received_size > 0);
 *    @endcode
 *  - Step2: If the application received #BT_SPP_READY_TO_READ_IND event, it can continue to read the rest of received data.
 *    @code
 *        do {
 *            int32_t real_received_size = 0;
 *            real_received_size = bt_spp_read(port, app_rx_buffer + total_received_size, total_size - total_received_size);
 *            if (real_received_size > 0) {
 *                total_received_size += real_received_size;
 *            } else {
 *                break;
 *            }
 *        } while (total_size - total_received_size > 0);
 *    @endcode
 * -  Disconnect the SPP connection.
 *  - Step1: Call #bt_spp_disconnect() to disconnect the SPP connection from a remote device.
 *    @code
 *           ret = bt_spp_disconnect(port);
 *    @endcode
 *  - Step2: A #BT_SPP_DISCONNECT_IND event will notify application callback function to indicate the result of the disconnection.
 *    @code
 *       app_callback(bt_event_t event_id, void* parameter)
 *       {
 *           switch (event_id) {
 *               case BT_SPP_DISCONNECT_IND:
 *                   if (parameter->result == BT_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
 *                       //SPP disconnected
 *                   }
 *                   break;
 *               default:
 *                   break;
 *           }
 *       }
 *    @endcode
 * -  Stop a SPP server in Server mode.
 *  - Step1: Call #bt_spp_stop_service() to delete the SPP server instance by unregistering the RFCOMM channel and SDP service record.
 *           The remote client will no longer be able to connect to the server.
 *    @code
 *           ret = bt_spp_stop_service(port);
 *    @endcode
